# US-Vaccination-Tracker
# Visualizing US Vaccination Data using Folium
This project visualizes the percentage of vaccinated population in each state of the US on a map using the Folium library. The user can choose a specific date and the code calculates the percentage of the US population vaccinated on that date. The project uses two datasets, one for population data and the other for vaccination data. The code merges the two datasets to get the required information for visualizing the map.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:</br>
pandas
math
folium

## Usage
To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install the required libraries:</br>
pip install pandas math folium

The script will output the percentage of the US population vaccinated on the chosen date and display a map visualizing the percentage of vaccinated population in each state of the US.

## Dataset
The project uses two datasets:</br>
2019_Census_US_Population_Data_By_State_Lat_Long.csv: This dataset contains the population data for each state of the US along with their latitude and longitude.</br>
USA_VaccinationData.csv: This dataset contains the vaccination data for each state of the US.
